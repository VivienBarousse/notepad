Notepad
=======

Draw a piano on a paper pad, and start playing it!

Notepad uses your webcam to detect the piano you just drew and your fingers,
and starts playing notes when you press keys on your paper piano.

This is my hack for London Music Hack Day 2013. It's still
in progress, but the complete code will make it here entirely,
eventually.

Early prototype, using a sharpie with some red tape to play the keys.

Working version, using two fingers to play at separate ends of the piano.
